# fix-simple-binary-encoding

This project contains specifications and resources for Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).
SBE is a FIX standard for binary message encoding. 

## *News*

[application/sbe](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/sbe) has been registered as a media type (formerly MIME type) at Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). A media type defines the format of the contents of an Internet message.

## Protocol stack
SBE is part of a family of protocols created by the High Performance Working Group
 of the FIX Trading Community. SBE is a presentation layer protocol (layer 6).

## Versions

### Planned Lifecycle

The planned lifecycle of this project is to roll out new features in a series of release candidates. After each release candidate is approved, it will be exposed to public review. Issues may be entered here in GitHub or in a discussion forum on the FIX Trading Community site. When a version is considered complete, the last release candidate will be promoted to Draft Standard. Following further public review, a Draft Standard may be promoted to the final specification for that version. Only minor errata are permitted. To reach the final stage, the Draft Standard must be reviewed for no less than 6 months, and at least two interoperable implementations must be certified. That version is henceforth immutable.

SBE version 1.0 has reached the final technical specification stage while release candidates have been developed for proposed version 2.0. 

### Version 2.0 Release Candidate 2

Version 2.0 RC2 was approved by the Global Technical Committee on August 15, 2019 for 90 day public review. 

Themes of this release:

* Clarification about single-byte character sets
* Improvement of the XML schema, including support for XInclude

### Version 2.0 Release Candidate 1

Version 2.0 RC1 was approved by the Global Technical Committee on August 16, 2018 for 90 day public review. Features were added due to popular demand. Because it is not interoperable with version 1.0 due to minor wire format changes, it was designated as a major version.

Themes of this release:

* Further enhancements to the schema extension mechanism
* Improvement of the XML schema

### Version: 1.0 Technical Specification
Version 1.0 Draft Standard was promoted to SBE version 1.0 Technical Specification by the Global Technical Committee on Feb. 9, 2016. This is the final specification of version 1.0.

The standard met these criteria for promotion:
* More than 6 months public review. During the period, some minor errors were found, and the errata were incorporated into the final specification. Thanks to users who detected those errors.

* At least two interopable implementations. This was demonstrated with the conformance test suite described below.

SBE standards are available here in GitHub and on the [FIX Trading Community](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/structure/tech-specs/simple-binary-encoding) site. 

SBE version 1.0 specification with errata was posted July 27, 2018.

#### XML namespace
The XML namespace for SBE version 1.0 message schemas is [http://fixprotocol.io/2016/sbe](http://fixprotocol.io/2016/sbe).

### Participation
All users are encouraged to contribute, especially by reviewing proposed changes in the form of pull requests. Your feedback counts.

Interested parties who wish to participate in the FIX High Performance Working Group should contact fix@fixtrading.org and state that your interest is in SBE, which sometimes meets as a subgroup. Membership in FIX Trading Community is not required to participate in technical working groups.

### Conformance test suite
The [SBE Conformance project](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-sbe-conformance) provides a conformance test suite to verify interoperability of SBE implementations. All implementors are invited to demonstrate their conformance to the standard.
